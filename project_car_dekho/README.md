# 🚗 CarDekho Car Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project demonstrates a machine learning workflow to predict car prices using historical data from CarDekho. Leveraging **Linear Regression**, it models the relationship between various car features and their market value, offering a practical example of regression analysis in the automotive domain.

## 📊 Workflow Overview

1. **Data Loading**: Import the CarDekho dataset containing car listings and prices.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understand feature distributions, correlations, and outliers.
3. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values
   - Encode categorical variables
   - Feature scaling (if needed)
4. **Model Building**:
   - Train a **Linear Regression** model
   - Evaluate using metrics like R² score, MAE, and RMSE
5. **Prediction**:
   - Generate price predictions for test data
   - Visualize actual vs predicted prices
