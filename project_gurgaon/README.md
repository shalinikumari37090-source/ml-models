# 🏡 House Price Prediction using Random Forest Regressor

This project demonstrates a supervised machine learning approach to predict house prices using the **RandomForestRegressor** algorithm. It walks through a practical regression workflow—from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation—using Python and scikit-learn.

---

## 📌 Objective

To build a robust regression model that accurately estimates house prices based on historical data and relevant features. The Random Forest algorithm is chosen for its ability to handle non-linear relationships and reduce overfitting through ensemble learning.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- Python 🐍
- pandas & NumPy for data manipulation
- scikit-learn for model building and evaluation
- matplotlib & seaborn for visualization
- Jupyter Notebook or any IDE of choice

## 📊 Workflow Overview

1. **Data Collection**: Load the dataset containing house features and target prices.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features.
3. **Feature Selection**: Identify the most relevant predictors for price estimation.
4. **Model Training**: Fit a `RandomForestRegressor` to the training data.
5. **Evaluation**: Assess model performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R² score.
6. **Prediction**: Generate price predictions on test or unseen data.

## 🌲 Why Random Forest?

Random Forest is a powerful ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and averages their outputs. It offers:

- High accuracy
- Resistance to overfitting
- Feature importance insights
- Flexibility with both numerical and categorical data
