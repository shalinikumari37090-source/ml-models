# ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Models Collection

This repository showcases a curated set of machine learning models built using Python, pandas, and scikit-learn. Each model is designed to solve real-world problems with clean workflows, reproducible code, and insightful evaluation metric that performs very well on a given dataset. The dataset used here is again cleaned and preprocessed by me and have good space for data visualization if needed.
# ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Models Collection

## ðŸ“‚ What's Inside
- Supervised learning models: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests
- Classification tasks: Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN
- Model evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC curves
- Preprocessing pipelines: Handling missing data, scaling, encoding
- Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step explanations

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
To demonstrate practical ML workflows for data science projects, with a focus on clarity, modularity, and interpretability.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
Clone the repo, open the notebooks, and explore how each model is built, tuned, and evaluated.
